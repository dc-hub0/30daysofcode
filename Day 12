You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.


class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeTwoLists(list1, list2):
    # Create a dummy node to start the merged list
    dummy = ListNode(-1)
    current = dummy

    # Traverse both lists and merge them
    while list1 and list2:
        if list1.val <= list2.val:
            current.next = list1
            list1 = list1.next
        else:
            current.next = list2
            list2 = list2.next
        current = current.next

    # Append the remaining nodes of list1 or list2
    current.next = list1 if list1 else list2

    # Return the head of the merged list
    return dummy.next
