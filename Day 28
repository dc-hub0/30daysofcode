An array is considered special if every pair of its adjacent elements contains two numbers with different parity. You are given an array of integer nums and a 2D integer matrix queries, where for queries[i] = [fromi, toi] your task is to check that 
subarray nums[fromi..toi] is special or not. Return an array of booleans answer such that answer[i] is true if nums[fromi..toi] is special.

CODE:
class Solution {
    public boolean[] isArraySpecial(int[] nums, int[][] queries) {
        int n=nums.length;
        int count[]=new int[n];
        count[0]=0;
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            int parity=(nums[i]%2==nums[i-1]%2)?1:0;
            count[i]=count[i-1]+parity;
        }
        int m=queries.length;
        boolean res[] = new boolean[m];
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
            int start=queries[i][0];
            int end=queries[i][1];
            res[i]=((count[end]-count[start])==0);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
